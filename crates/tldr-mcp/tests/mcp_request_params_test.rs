//! M7 VAL-007 — MCP request-side params camelCase compliance.
//!
//! Closes parcadei/tldr-code#19 (request-side audit). M4 fixed the
//! response-side (`InitializeResult` now emits `protocolVersion` /
//! `serverInfo`). M7 fixes the symmetric REQUEST-side bug: the
//! `InitializeParams` struct has snake_case field names
//! (`protocol_version`, `client_info`) without `#[serde(rename = ...)]`
//! or `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`. When a spec-compliant client
//! (e.g. Claude Code) sends camelCase params per MCP 2024-11-05 wire
//! spec, serde silently fails to bind those keys → fields default to
//! `None` (each field carries `#[serde(default)]`) → the server
//! processes a degraded request, silently losing client identity, the
//! protocol version it announced, and any experimental capabilities it
//! declared — all the diagnostic eprintln paths in
//! `server::handle_initialize` (server.rs:120-145) become dead code
//! when the live client is spec-compliant.
//!
//! # Test design
//!
//! The bug is a serde-level deserialization failure, so the cleanest
//! reproduction is at the deserialize boundary: parse the canonical
//! camelCase JSON payload directly into `InitializeParams` and assert
//! every field is populated with the value sent (NOT defaulted). To
//! also confirm the fix flows through the full server dispatch path
//! that Claude Code exercises, a second test drives the same payload
//! through `server::process_request` and reasserts via the response
//! shape that the inputs reached the handler intact.
//!
//! # RED-REASON gate (per contract VAL-007)
//!
//! Pre-fix the assertion `parsed.client_info.is_some()` fails — the
//! panic message names the dropped field by reproducing the JSON we
//! sent (which contains the literal substring `clientInfo`) and
//! reporting the parsed value (`None`). Both `clientInfo` and
//! `client_info` appear in the panic, satisfying the gate requirement
//! that the RED stdout name a specific dropped field.
//!
//! # Symmetry note with M4
//!
//! M4's tests assert *response* keys are camelCase. M7's tests assert
//! *request* keys are accepted in camelCase. Together they certify the
//! full handshake direction is wire-spec compliant.
