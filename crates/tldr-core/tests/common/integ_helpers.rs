//! regex-removal-v1 — shared integration-test helpers.
//!
//! Extracted in W1.5-M6 from the inline duplicate copies in
//! `rr_framework_integ_test.rs`, `rr_stdlib_integ_test.rs`, and the seed
//! `val002_member_access_structural_test.rs`. Provides a single source of
//! truth for the analyze() pipeline used by every Wave-1.5+ integration
//! test:
//!
//!   parse → CFG → DFG → SSA (optional) → compute_taint_with_tree
//!
//! Helper signatures match the originals exactly — refactor is shape-
//! preserving. This file is loaded into integration-test crates via
//! `#[path = "common/integ_helpers.rs"] mod common;` (mirroring the
//! `#[path = "support/..."] mod support;` convention already used by
//! `surface_language_profile_tests.rs`).
//!
//! Cargo also auto-treats `tests/common/mod.rs` as a non-test module; we
//! avoid that path to stay consistent with the existing repo convention
//! and to keep the helper file name explicit per the W1.5-M6 dispatch
//! contract.
